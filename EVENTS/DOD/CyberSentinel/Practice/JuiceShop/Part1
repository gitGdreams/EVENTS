=================================================
Look for scoreboard first
In JS files, search "path:" > look for scoreboard > look at JS files >
main.js looks sus > beautify the code using https://codebeautify.org/jsviewer# >look for "td = [{" or "path:" it give a lot of links >
look for score > this is what I'm looking for "path: "score-board"," > that's the beginning and by inspecting further 
I found a lot of useful stuff.

CHALLENGES
===============
==D1==
=XSS=
--DOM XSS--
Read the tip > copy-paste in search box > easy
Code review > remove the bypass of sanitization

--Bonus Payload--
Same as DOM XSS
Code review > remove the bypass of sanitization

=Sensitive Data Exposure=
--Confidential Document--
Check "About Us" > there's a link for downloading legal.md > inspect it >
there is > href="ftp/legal.md" > in url > [target]/ftp > Got the juice
random downloading stuff then boom > acquisitions.md > is the confidential document
Code review > get rid of the entire /ftp folder to prevent leakage
In the process I solved:
=Error Handling (Provoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled.)=

--Exposed Metrics--
Soooo, Just tamper with url and put /metrics after the url > Solved
Code review > app.get('/metrics' > security.isAdmin() > only admin people's eyes

=Improper Input Validation=
--Missing Encoding--
comparing other images, no hashes in the working once > maybe URL encoding will do the job

--Repetative Registration--
DRY principle means Don't Repeat Yourself > register as a new user by not repeating password >
OWASP ZAP > Break the site > right click the url in left pane then click "Break" >
do the thing > boom!! got it!!!

--Zero Stars--
