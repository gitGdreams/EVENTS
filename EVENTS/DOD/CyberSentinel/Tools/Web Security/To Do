OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP): Start with ZAP as it's a versatile open-source tool designed specifically for web application security testing. 
  It can help you identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including injection flaws, broken authentication, and sensitive data exposure.

Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite next, as it provides comprehensive scanning capabilities and allows for manual testing through its proxy functionality. 
  You can use it to further analyze the application's behavior and detect vulnerabilities that ZAP might have missed.

Nikto: After ZAP and Burp Suite, run Nikto to perform a quick scan for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on the web server. 
  It can identify issues such as outdated software versions, insecure configurations, and potentially dangerous files.

SQLMap: If you suspect SQL injection vulnerabilities based on the initial scans, use SQLMap to automate the detection and exploitation of these vulnerabilities. 
  SQLMap is highly effective at extracting data from databases and demonstrating the impact of SQL injection flaws.

XSStrike: Finally, use XSStrike to specifically target and exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 
  XSS vulnerabilities are prevalent in web applications and can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking and defacement.
